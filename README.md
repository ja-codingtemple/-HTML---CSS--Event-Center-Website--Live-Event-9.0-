# Starter Code - HTML & CSS [Event Center Website]

Feel free to use this as starter code for your project.
You can either clone the repository or download the zip file.

## What you still need to do to complete this project
- Add an image to your welcome section on ``index.html``
- Create a table on ``menu.html`` to display a food menu. There should be at least two category headers and two rows per category.
- Embed a Google Map or map image in ``location.html`` alongside the event address and hours or nearby landmarks. (Make sure this is centered.)
- On ``contact.html`` build a form with the fields ``name`` ``email`` ``message/inquiry``. Apply form validation to ensure required fields are filled. (The curriculum teaches you how to do this.)
- Make sure all web pages are responsive. You can utilize media queries to do this.
- Use flexbox or grid for layout and alignment. (This project uses flexbox by default.)
- Style your contact form.
- Finally, add hover effects for interactive elements such as buttons, links, and images.
